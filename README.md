  E(lf)-Mail
  <br>
</h1>

Play as an elf who picks up and delivers mail between the windowsills of a charming city. In this relaxing platformer, make use of a satisfying movement system to hop, slide, spin, and dance between the rooftops.

This short game was developed in 48 hours for the [Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam 2021](https://dentrala.itch.io/elf-mail), which features the theme "Joined Together". Even when people cannot be together, there are still ways to stay connected. This game introduces a whimsical approach to the words, "no one is an island".

We hope you enjoy helping join people together. (and scaring the pigeons!)

Arrow Keys to Move, Space to jump, Down+Space to drop.
